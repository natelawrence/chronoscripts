Yes
after
long
delays
here
it
is
Chrontendo
Episode
49
only
one
more
episode
away
from
our
50th
episode
yay
So
today
we're
gonna
finish
up
September
1989
and
move
into
October
surprisingly
enough
However
we
still
have
to
pass
through
some
rather
murky
waters
om
as
we
finish
up
September
U
S
releases
with
three
games
from
L
J
N
including
a
rather
infamous
movie
adaptation
But
we
also
have
a
very
fondly
remembered
game
from
Capcom
and
also
an
actual
game
published
by
Nintendo
themselves
We
will
also
see
another
installment
in
one
of
my
favorite
ever
game
series
Yep
It's
another
Fist
of
the
North
Star
game
Alright
With
that
said
let's
get
started
There
were
a
total
of
six
games
released
on
September
29th
and
we
covered
two
of
last
time
including
Uninvited
and
we'll
start
today
with
the
remaining
four
including
Thunderbirds
from
Pack
In
Video
who
tended
to
specialize
in
T
V
and
movie
license
stuff
We've
already
seen
Rambo
and
uh
Predator
from
them
This
intro
has
some
nice
multi
layer
scrolling
effects
Obviously
Thunderbirds
is
based
on
the
well
loved
1960s
British
T
V
show
of
the
same
name
While
it's
more
of
a
cultural
touchstone
in
the
U
the
United
States
I
suspect
that
most
people
who
grew
up
in
the
'70s
'80s
encountered
it
at
some
point
It
was
a
somewhat
uh
common
sight
on
American
T
V
via
syndication
during
those
decades
The
original
T
V
show
was
broadcast
from
1965
to
1966
the
original
series
only
lasted
32
episodes
Created
by
Gerry
and
Sylvia
Anderson
Thunderbirds
was
one
of
several
T
V
series
to
feature
uh
Supermarionation
which
basically
means
uh
fancy
ass
marionettes
Others
from
them
included
Supercar
Captain
Scarlet
uh
and
Fireball
X
L
5
The
Thunderbirds
consist
of
Jeff
Tracy
in
the
bottom
corner
there
and
his
five
sons
each
of
which
drive
a
uh
super
high
tech
Thunderbird
vehicle
Oh
my
God
Why
are
you
jacking
off
in
front
of
your
kids
The
story
here
is
that
the
Thunderbirds
arch
villain
The
Hood
who
was
sort
of
a
stereotypical
Fu
Manchu
Yellow
Menace
type
villain
he's
gonna
start
uh
wrecking
shit
using
meteors
Hood
gives
the
Thunderbirds
a
60
day
deadline
to
turn
over
their
uh
special
Thunderbird
vehicles
to
him
As
a
result
Thunderbirds
doesn't
have
a
life
system
but
rather
a
time
limit
have
to
finish
the
game
in
sixty
days
and
you
can
die
as
many
times
as
you
want
in
that
sixty
day
time
period
We've
seen
some
pretty
good
Shoot
'em
Ups
um
for
the
N
E
S
but
this
is
definitely
not
one
of
them
It's
about
the
most
generic
uninspired
thing
you
can
possibly
imagine
Ships
fly
down
at
you
and
you
shoot
them
there's
also
turrets
and
tanks
and
things
The
tanks
are
actually
super
annoying
since
their
projectiles
move
very
fast
They're
pretty
much
impossible
to
dodge
if
you
just
happen
to
be
in
their
line
of
fire
so
you'll
have
to
memorize
where
the
tanks
are
going
to
appear
There's
a
very
basic
power
up
system
You
can
upgrade
your
main
gun
twice
and
get
two
orbiters
that
act
like
Gradius
style
options
or
little
planes
that
fly
next
to
you
as
in
the
uh
1942
games
and
that's
about
it
When
you
die
Brain
the
Thunderbirds
science
guy
chides
you
for
damaging
the
ship
Despite
uh
seeing
your
ship
explode
into
a
million
pieces
Brain
says
it
can
be
repaired
in
three
days
So
the
sixty
day
timer
counts
down
every
time
you
complete
a
level
and
loses
three
days
every
time
you
die
Also
getting
killed
returns
you
all
the
way
to
the
beginning
of
the
level
I
didn't
encounter
any
bosses
exactly
in
this
game
but
many
levels
end
with
some
kind
of
roadblock
that
you
have
to
fight
your
way
through
The
game
is
not
strictly
linear
you
can
select
the
order
in
which
you
the
different
locations
Depending
on
the
type
of
location
you'll
be
given
one
of
the
five
Thunderbird
vehicles
Oh
God
I
hate
this
level
Is
this
game
trying
to
make
you
vomit
Geez
That's
some
laser
For
a
game
based
on
a
T
V
show
the
narrative
structure
is
pretty
weak
The
levels
feel
kind
of
pointless
A
level
begins
you
shoot
some
guys
for
a
bit
and
then
the
level
just
ends
and
you
get
some
dialogue
explaining
that
now
you've
gotta
travel
to
some
other
part
of
the
world
The
levels
themes
are
mostly
just
borrowed
from
better
shooters
This
looks
like
1942
or
one
of
military
shooters
So
basically
it's
just
a
bunch
of
completely
uninteresting
shooter
levels
kind
of
tossed
together
and
a
licensed
property
slapped
on
top
For
some
reason
it
was
deemed
worthy
of
a
U
S
release
by
Activision
who
kept
the
name
Thunderbirds
and
the
characters
names
but
didn't
otherwise
reference
the
T
V
show
anywhere
in
the
packaging
or
the
manual
even
altering
the
iconic
logo
I'm
not
even
sure
why
this
game
was
created
Thunderbirds
were
hardly
a
fresh
property
in
1989
and
a
remake
or
anything
happening
at
that
far
as
I
know
so
this
does
seem
like
kind
of
a
strange
choice
for
Pack
In
Video
to
put
out
So
just
like
another
game
we'll
be
move
on
a
somewhat
better
shooter
From
our
good
buddies
Konami
it's
TwinBee
3
Poko
Poko
Dai
Maou
or
Great
Devil
King
Poko
Poko
Real
quick
let's
take
a
look
at
the
menu
screen
There's
an
Options
menu
at
the
bottom
Here
we
can
choose
uh
two
difficulty
levels
Easy
which
is
pretty
easy
and
that's
what
we'll
playing
today
and
Hard
which
is
pretty
damn
hard
but
no
Normal
difficulty
So
here
you
pick
your
ship
either
TwinBee
or
WinBee
and
choose
how
many
lives
ya
have
For
the
purpose
of
my
sanity
I'll
give
myself
ten
lives
You
can
also
pick
which
stage
you
wanna
start
on
This
is
the
third
and
last
TwinBee
game
for
the
system
Earlier
we
saw
the
uh
the
first
TwinBee
game
which
is
a
port
of
the
arcade
game
Then
in
1986
there
was
a
console
only
sequel
Moero
TwinBee
this
was
released
in
the
U
S
as
Stinger
Now
three
years
later
we
have
TwinBee
3
which
I'd
say
is
better
than
the
first
two
The
main
distinguishing
factor
in
TwinBee
is
the
system
of
collecting
bells
When
you
shoot
clouds
bells
pop
up
gold
bells
give
you
points
Shooting
the
bells
will
change
the
color
For
example
blue
bells
are
speed
ups
white
bells
give
you
a
double
shot
If
you
keep
shooting
them
you
can
get
even
more
options
Um
However
this
can
be
a
bit
tricky
uh
shooting
them
when
you're
also
in
the
middle
of
shooting
at
enemies
and
trying
to
dodge
them
It
is
very
easy
to
accidentally
shoot
the
bell
and
change
its
color
to
something
that
you
don't
want
And
one
very
essential
part
in
TwinBee
is
to
avoid
the
blue
bells
Getting
a
few
will
speed
you
up
sufficiently
but
accidentally
continuing
to
ah
pick
them
up
will
make
your
ship
way
too
fast
to
accurately
control
TwinBee
uses
a
Xevious
like
double
weapon
system
Um
You
fire
your
main
weapons
at
airborne
enemies
and
drop
bombs
on
ground
enemies
complete
with
a
little
Xevious
style
targeting
reticule
Bombing
things
will
sometimes
reveal
hidden
items
like
a
question
mark
that
destroys
all
the
enemies
onscreen
or
here
a
better
weapon
power
up
You
can
get
a
laser
beam
weapon
from
the
bells
but
the
spreadshot
is
only
found
in
a
few
places
in
the
game
when
you
bomb
the
correct
item
Probably
the
best
part
about
TwinBee
3
are
the
bosses
They're
actually
all
quite
odd
and
creative
in
a
very
sort
of
goofy
way
such
as
this
guy
a
uh
leather
and
spike
clad
Buddha
who
divides
into
smaller
and
smaller
versions
of
himself
as
you
uh
wear
down
his
health
After
uh
beating
a
boss
you
can
under
certain
conditions
play
a
bonus
level
to
collect
yellow
bells
for
points
And
this
is
pretty
much
the
extent
of
the
game
Uh
Each
level
has
a
different
theme
This
is
a
sea
themed
level
You
drop
bombs
on
starfish
shoot
jellyfish
and
whales
and
also
large
white
butterflies
for
some
reason
which
are
normally
not
found
out
in
the
ocean
The
boss
is
quite
odd
these
three
guys
are
performing
a
musical
number
and
the
music
is
actually
pretty
wild
'n
the
whole
uh
boss
fight
is
actually
reasonably
amusing
As
I
mentioned
Easy
mode
is
pretty
damn
easy
A
couple
of
reasons
for
this
aside
from
the
enemies
being
much
less
aggressive
is
that
you
can
actually
take
three
hits
before
dying
The
first
two
hits
uh
will
blow
each
of
your
arms
off
When
this
happens
a
health
refill
will
drop
which
restores
your
arms
When
you
do
die
you
can
uh
keep
your
power
ups
if
you
go
grab
the
spirit
of
your
departed
ship
before
it
flies
away
to
heaven
This
boss
is
also
pretty
creative
and
amazing
um
you
shoot
out
little
fellows
living
in
the
dragon's
teeth
The
fourth
and
last
regular
stage
is
a
uh
so
called
dungeon
level
though
it
looks
like
it
takes
place
in
a
mine
rather
than
a
dungeon
It
then
moves
into
a
flooded
area
with
Roman
style
columns
Again
I'm
not
really
sure
what
the
is
supposed
to
be
here
Ah
here
we
have
uh
this
very
rare
torch
item
which
does
nothing
upon
getting
it
but
then
the
next
bell
you
hit
will
drop
a
power
up
for
temporary
invincibility
The
least
interesting
boss
follows
a
sea
serpent
which
simply
pops
up
and
shoots
lightning
at
you
really
nothing
too
special
there
Finally
we
get
to
the
last
level
a
surreal
level
full
of
magic
hats
cannons
electric
fans
playing
cards
and
Jack
o
Lanterns
It's
pretty
frantic
since
cannonballs
are
indestructible
and
the
fans
will
cause
you
to
sort
of
lose
control
of
your
ship
and
sort
of
push
you
around
a
bit
on
the
screen
However
this
isn't
nearly
as
interesting
looking
as
the
earlier
levels
with
its
plain
green
and
blue
uh
checkerboard
design
The
final
boss
however
is
absolutely
nuts
looking
I
mean
just
look
at
this
guy
It's
not
immediately
obvious
what
to
do
but
it's
simply
a
matter
of
shooting
out
the
bottom
of
the
floating
island
he's
sitting
on
And
the
fact
this
is
so
easy
is
makes
this
final
battle
kind
of
a
little
anticlimactic
TwinBee
3
is
hardly
the
best
shooter
on
the
FamiCom
On
the
other
hand
compared
to
all
the
other
mostly
terrible
shooters
we've
been
seeing
lately
it's
pretty
playable
I
wish
they
hadn't
put
that
large
bar
at
the
bottom
of
the
screen
that
shows
your
score
as
it
takes
up
quite
a
bit
of
uh
vertical
space
It's
cute
the
levels
and
enemies
are
mostly
charming
it
doesn't
feel
unreasonably
unfair
or
cheap
Quite
frankly
the
TwinBee
series
wouldn't
really
take
off
until
the
next
arcade
game
um
Detana
TwinBee
which
we'll
see
on
the
uh
P
C
Engine
Either
way
it's
still
a
lot
better
than
other
two
shooters
this
episode
Alright
moving
right
along
here
here's
one
from
Sunsoft
Maharaja
a
rather
unusual
Adventure
game
that's
got
all
mixed
up
with
an
R
P
G
game
While
it
was
published
by
Sunsoft
I
think
it
may
have
been
developed
by
Quest
Now
this
was
never
released
outside
of
Japan
but
we
do
have
a
fan
translation
here
that'll
sort
of
help
us
appreciate
the
game
more
Checking
out
like
the
the
graphics
you'll
see
some
of
the
character
design
in
actually
pretty
good
So
apparently
there
were
uh
limitations
in
regards
to
the
number
of
characters
they
could
squeeze
in
on
the
menu
panel
on
the
left
hand
side
Thus
uh
for
example
om
see
becomes
S
E
show
becomes
S
H
O
and
and
so
on
I
guess
they
om
when
they
translated
this
they
didn't
they
didn't
actually
do
the
hacking
to
like
you
know
change
the
uh
the
character
width
or
something
like
that
So
you
happen
to
find
uh
the
Maharaja's
box
in
a
river
You
bring
it
to
the
Maharaja
who
treats
you
as
an
honored
guest
However
that
night
a
princess
reveals
to
you
that
you
are
going
to
be
killed
the
next
day
in
some
kind
of
like
sacrificial
rite
or
something
like
that
Um
So
far
this
is
a
very
by
the
numbers
menu
based
Adventure
game
Om
The
first
thing
you
do
here
is
to
find
your
way
out
of
the
palace
There's
no
obvious
way
out
since
the
only
exit
is
guarded
um
but
eventually
you'll
figure
out
thereâ€™s
like
a
hidden
door
that
a
statue
And
you
are
of
course
um
some
kind
of
Chosen
One
who's
destined
to
save
the
world
or
something
like
that
Um
The
actual
game
world
is
set
up
just
like
many
many
other
Adventure
games
There's
basically
a
series
of
uh
sort
of
connected
screens
you
can
travel
among
using
the
menu
commands
So
for
example
from
the
Swami
you
can
move
to
the
town
square
and
from
there
you
can
go
one
step
over
to
the
weapons
shop
or
n
in
another
direction
to
the
inn
And
there's
a
shop
that
sells
like
consumable
items
as
well
Also
right
next
to
the
town
square
is
a
jungle
And
uh
here
you
is
where
you
can
actually
find
enemies
and
random
encounters
These
battles
work
just
like
every
other
J
R
P
G
Um
There's
a
menu
option
to
fight
Eh
You
can
use
magic
use
items
and
so
on
You'll
gain
both
gold
and
experience
from
winning
battles
and
as
you
gain
levels
you
can
learn
spells
or
mantras
as
Now
once
you
figure
out
you
can
bribe
Ganesha
by
giving
him
an
item
you'll
be
able
to
talk
to
Shiva
who
has
sort
of
like
an
an
animÃ©
character
face
here
Now
whenever
you
talk
to
him
you
can
learn
new
mantras
if
you've
reached
the
sufficient
level
The
first
two
are
a
Heal
spell
and
a
Teleportation
spell
which
are
actually
uh
pretty
useful
when
you
think
about
it
After
that
there's
lots
of
other
spells
that
can
be
used
in
battle
a
fireball
spell
and
a
spell
that
freezes
an
enemy
or
one
that
prevents
them
from
using
magic
and
and
so
on
Pretty
much
kind
of
very
sort
of
typical
J
R
P
G
spells
So
this
hybrid
Adventure
game
R
P
G
system
is
pretty
unusual
There
were
a
couple
other
games
that
attempted
similar
ideas
for
example
Square's
1987
F
D
S
game
Cleopatra
no
Mahou
which
we
covered
back
in
Episode
20
and
Kujaku
Ou
from
Episode
35
Now
one
issue
here
is
that
unlike
the
giant
overworlds
found
in
R
the
area
in
which
you
can
move
around
is
somewhat
small
I
mean
everythingâ€™s
like
really
really
close
You
don't
actually
move
around
a
lot
The
jungle
is
the
uh
the
first
place
in
the
beginning
of
the
game
actually
encounter
enemies
but
it's
not
that
big
only
around
six
by
six
squares
So
you
have
to
spend
a
time
being
just
sort
of
like
you
know
going
going
back
and
forth
in
order
to
actually
gain
a
few
levels
There's
not
much
like
exploration
of
the
world
in
this
game
Eventually
you'll
find
the
towers
if
you
take
the
correct
path
through
the
jungle
The
enemies
in
the
Iron
Tower
are
a
bit
stronger
and
you'll
need
to
gain
several
more
levels
to
get
very
far
So
again
you
need
to
grind
in
the
Iron
Tower
As
far
as
dungeons
go
the
towers
are
pretty
dull
They're
simply
a
uh
a
a
regular
straight
path
going
forward
with
a
constant
stream
of
enemies
at
each
step
and
then
a
boss
battle
at
the
end
So
once
you
get
all
the
way
through
the
Iron
Tower
you'll
find
an
item
om
a
chest
that
will
unlock
the
door
connecting
the
Iron
and
the
Silver
Towers
But
to
leave
the
Iron
Tower
you
have
to
backtrack
all
the
way
to
the
front
door
Then
the
only
way
into
the
Silver
Tower
is
to
go
all
the
way
through
the
Iron
Tower
again
and
then
travel
down
the
long
hallways
of
the
Silver
Tower
and
so
on
So
these
rather
long
completely
linear
dungeons
are
actually
pretty
damn
monotonous
Maharaja
doesn't
really
satisfy
as
an
R
P
G
or
Adventure
game
There's
not
really
much
exploration
as
I
mentioned
there's
nothing
really
in
the
way
of
puzzle
solving
It's
a
very
curious
oddity
And
it's
not
exactly
poorly
made
I
mean
the
quality
of
everything
seems
relatively
high
but
the
sort
of
lack
of
variety
may
frustrate
you
One
So
far
none
of
the
games
we've
seen
from
Use
have
even
been
remotely
good
This
one
however
is
at
least
a
little
weird
It's
sort
of
a
combination
Adventure
game
and
Military
Strategy
game
It's
basically
two
different
games
sort
of
stitched
together
into
a
Frankenstein
game
Meiji
Ishin
is
what
we
call
the
Meiji
Restoration
That
is
the
period
in
the
late
19th
and
early
20th
century
which
uh
resulted
in
the
overthrow
of
the
shogunate
and
the
reinstatement
um
of
the
Emperor
as
the
actual
ruling
power
in
Japan
Obviously
this
game
is
very
Japanese
heavy
and
will
not
be
much
interest
to
most
of
us
but
we
will
still
take
a
quick
little
look
at
it
I
think
you
might
be
playing
as
SaigÅ
Takamori
or
some
other
historical
figure
not
sure
who
exactly
The
first
part
o
the
game
has
you
traveling
to
Edo
to
gather
allies
The
second
half
switches
over
to
a
simple
math
based
Military
Strategy
game
based
on
I
think
the
Boshin
War
of
the
1860s
I'm
not
sure
Not
having
the
patience
to
get
through
this
you
know
kind
of
a
long
game
I'll
be
looking
just
at
the
first
half
today
You
have
the
typical
action
menu
on
the
right
hand
side
of
the
screen
with
the
uh
standard
options
of
Move
Look
Talk
et
cetera
The
opening
section
of
the
game
is
basically
one
of
those
you
know
press
the
A
button
to
advance
kinda
deals
You
might
call
it
walking
down
the
road
simulation
game
because
you
do
a
lot
of
walking
from
town
to
town
You
often
need
to
speak
to
a
guard
each
town
and
show
your
pass
or
something
You'll
also
have
these
very
uneventful
encounters
along
the
road
Uh
At
one
point
someone
comes
up
behind
you
and
keeps
tapping
you
on
the
shoulder
until
you
turn
around
Good
stuff
Eventually
some
excitement
happens
when
you
get
trained
in
the
combat
system
Later
in
the
game
you'll
actually
encounter
enemies
and
fight
them
and
this
guy
trains
you
how
to
fight
When
green
or
red
dots
appear
you
need
to
press
the
the
correct
direction
and
hit
the
correct
button
green
dots
are
defense
and
red
are
offense
So
doing
these
correctly
will
keep
you
from
losing
life
and
will
cause
you
to
do
damage
to
the
enemy
though
this
guy
you
really
can't
actually
do
any
damage
to
After
you've
passed
this
training
exercise
you
have
to
do
it
another
three
times
Great
Then
it's
back
on
the
road
Eventually
at
some
point
well
into
the
game
you'll
have
real
fights
with
real
enemies
Um
I
think
that's
still
a
while
into
the
point
a
while
after
the
point
that
I
got
though
This
is
definitely
the
most
obscure
game
this
episode
It
doesn't
even
have
its
own
uh
page
on
Japanese
Wikipedia
The
first
chunk
of
the
game
is
so
repetitive
mean
literally
just
walking
down
the
road
and
talking
to
the
same
people
over
and
over
so
I
can
definitely
see
why
this
has
been
completely
forgotten
Well
here
it
is
another
one
of
those
games
L
J
N
's
Back
to
the
Future
developed
by
those
boys
from
Down
Under
Beam
Software
Beam
Software's
rÃ©sumÃ©
was
erratic
to
say
the
We've
already
seen
the
U
S
version
of
Airwolf
and
Bad
Street
Brawlers
from
them
both
of
which
were
just
incredibly
dull
and
sloppily
made
games
though
a
few
years
later
they
would
actually
produce
uh
Nightshade
and
Shadow
Run
So
yeah
pretty
weird
company
in
terms
of
the
quality
of
their
output
Their
name
is
mostly
associated
with
hastily
produced
crap
however
The
movie
came
out
in
1985
this
game
is
clearly
released
to
help
promote
Back
to
the
Future
II
which
would
arrive
in
theaters
in
September
of
1989
There
was
an
earlier
Back
to
the
Future
game
which
is
completely
unrelated
This
game
is
hated
and
despised
for
a
number
of
reasons
One
of
them
is
that
there
is
not
much
connection
to
the
movie
in
terms
of
the
actual
gameplay
The
majority
of
the
game
is
spent
uh
doing
this
walking
around
town
uh
in
a
series
of
sort
of
obstacle
course
like
levels
These
are
timed
forced
scrolling
levels
So
they
sort
of
resemble
a
uh
vertical
Shoot
'em
Up
in
some
ways
I
suppose
the
inspiration
might
be
Atari's
Paperboy
game
The
object
here
is
to
uh
keep
collecting
clocks
in
order
to
prevent
the
timer
from
running
down
Touching
anything
other
than
a
clock
to
fall
down
This
means
avoiding
women
with
a
hula
hoop
random
guys
who
charge
at
you
garbage
cans
park
benches
and
little
fences
or
whatever
the
hell
those
things
are
on
the
edge
of
the
sidewalk
Most
dangerous
though
are
the
enormous
bees
that
fly
around
since
they
fly
directly
at
you
and
normally
try
to
circle
back
around
you
to
you
from
behind
Hitting
anything
causes
you
to
fall
down
and
uh
sort
of
flop
around
on
the
ground
and
this
will
result
in
all
the
clocks
around
you
vanishing
so
you
lose
valuable
time
whenever
this
happens
Once
you
reach
the
end
of
this
section
you
move
onto
Uh
This
is
actually
the
same
thing
walking
down
the
sidewalk
You
do
this
four
times
in
a
row
until
you
reach
Lou's
Diner
Then
you
get
one
of
four
minigames
that
appear
in
Back
the
Future
The
first
one
has
you
throwing
root
beer
floats
at
the
dudes
that
try
to
rush
the
counter
If
one
reaches
the
counter
they'll
grab
you
and
toss
you
down
the
bar
into
the
door
Keep
in
mind
you
have
to
hit
these
guys
directly
in
the
head
Aiming
for
their
bodies
will
not
work
the
root
beer
float
will
just
sort
of
float
right
through
them
It's
not
that
difficult
in
theory
but
missing
once
will
cause
you
to
lose
the
level
and
you
need
to
knock
down
a
hundred
guys
Then
it's
back
to
the
walking
sequences
Eventually
you'll
get
to
the
library
where
you
encounter
the
next
minigame
Your
mother
throws
hearts
at
you
and
you
try
to
catch
them
Well
technically
you
aren't
catching
them
you're
blocking
them
with
a
textbook
or
something
But
if
you
don't
want
the
hearts
to
touch
you
wouldn't
you
just
uh
be
dodging
them
as
opposed
to
trying
to
sort
of
catch
them
with
your
book
somehow
I
don't
really
get
the
concept
here
So
this
pattern
repeats
four
times
some
walking
segments
then
a
uh
different
minigame
The
walking
segments
do
have
a
few
extra
features
You
can
grab
a
bowling
ball
and
throw
it
at
enemies
and
even
better
a
skateboard
which
allows
you
to
move
much
faster
Now
it's
really
easy
to
get
knocked
down
off
the
skateboard
but
it
goes
so
fast
that
even
if
you
remain
on
it
for
like
just
like
a
few
seconds
you're
almost
guaranteed
to
be
able
to
finish
the
level
before
the
time
runs
out
The
game
actually
has
two
sorts
of
timers
Do
you
remember
in
the
movie
there's
that
photograph
that
Marty
had
with
his
siblings
and
they
started
to
sort
of
fade
away
as
um
time
progressed
throughout
the
movie
Uh
Here's
actually
the
photo
from
the
movie
itself
And
then
compare
this
to
the
photo
in
the
game
Wow
those
guys
from
Beam
really
went
the
extra
mile
here
it's
like
looking
at
the
exact
same
picture
Anyway
if
the
picture
fades
completely
you
die
Aside
from
this
sort
of
thing
it
almost
feels
like
the
who
made
this
game
had
never
actually
seen
the
movie
My
main
issue
with
Back
to
the
Future
is
no
cohesion
between
the
different
parts
It's
essentially
a
handful
of
very
basic
minigames
kind
of
awkwardly
crammed
together
and
the
individual
games
feel
like
they
could
easily
be
from
the
Atari
2600
era
in
terms
of
gameplay
And
none
of
these
are
uh
little
minigames
are
actually
very
original
I
mentioned
uh
the
the
traveling
sequences
re
resembling
Paperboy
The
minigame
in
Lou's
Diner
where
you
throw
root
beer
floats
is
basically
the
same
thing
as
the
old
arcade
game
Tapper
And
the
game
in
the
library
where
you're
the
hearts
is
really
not
that
different
than
the
old
Atari
game
Kaboom
After
you
complete
this
guitar
playing
section
which
is
actually
really
easy
once
you
kind
of
wrap
your
head
around
it
you
make
your
way
to
the
final
section
where
we
need
to
race
the
DeLorean
to
reach
88
miles
per
hour
However
I
think
the
lightning
melts
the
roads
which
slows
you
down
so
need
to
avoid
all
the
ah
the
spots
where
the
lightning
has
hit
And
then
on
top
of
all
the
other
crap
this
game
throws
at
you
if
you
fail
at
this
part
even
once
you
get
a
total
Game
Over
I
mean
quite
frankly
I
recommend
abusing
the
Start
button
throughout
this
game
which
pauses
it
so
you
can
actually
see
in
advance
where
the
lightning
is
going
to
strike
and
then
you'll
be
able
to
avoid
it
a
bit
easier
It's
weird
that
used
a
pause
button
on
a
game
mostly
built
around
fast
reaction
times
I
mean
you
can
the
pause
button
to
pretty
much
beat
the
minigame
levels
like
involving
catching
hearts
or
catching
guitar
notes
but
pretty
much
everything
else
in
this
game
is
completely
this
as
well
Anyway
having
actually
played
this
game
I
can
now
understand
why
people
really
really
hate
it
Oh
man
Number
2
in
game
trilogy
N
F
L
despite
being
the
first
N
E
game
with
an
actual
official
N
F
L
license
is
almost
forgotten
today
It's
sorta
stuck
forever
living
in
the
shadow
of
its
far
superior
ah
rival
Tecmo
Bowl
So
when
we
say
N
F
L
license
uh
this
means
that
the
real
team
names
were
used
The
names
of
individual
players
were
not
used
since
that
would
actually
be
a
completely
different
license
For
game
select
you
can
choose
to
play
an
American
Conference
game
or
a
National
Conference
game
or
InterConference
or
Super
Bowl
I'm
not
really
sure
exactly
what
the
difference
between
Super
Bowl
and
InterConference
is
but
of
course
these
allow
you
to
choose
an
opponent
from
uh
the
other
conference
So
as
we
see
this
does
in
fact
use
the
real
life
team
names
But
for
the
players
we
only
get
the
position
names
You
have
the
option
to
upgrade
a
player
but
doing
so
will
penalize
you
by
supposedly
making
it
more
likely
you'll
have
a
penalty
called
on
you
Now
it's
not
a
hundred
percent
clear
who
developed
N
F
L
but
it
appears
that
Atlus
was
somehow
involved
um
as
they
were
in
several
other
L
J
N
games
Possibly
Sanritsu
may
have
also
been
involved
According
to
the
manual
Tom
Bass
coach
for
the
Buccaneers
and
the
Chargers
was
instrumental
in
the
development
of
this
game's
authentic
action
Bass
had
written
a
few
books
on
football
tactics
and
used
to
give
seminars
aimed
at
helping
women
understand
football
Of
course
what
exactly
he
did
on
this
game
is
anybody's
guess
So
basically
that
everything
that
uh
Tecmo's
uh
football
games
do
right
this
one
does
completely
wrong
The
little
arrows
over
the
heads
indicate
uh
which
player's
being
controlled
But
actually
controlling
anything
is
sometimes
needlessly
complicated
Whereas
Tecmo
Bowl
is
uh
pretty
damn
intuitive
in
terms
of
how
you
play
it
doing
stuff
in
N
F
L
involves
uh
pressing
a
series
of
buttons
that
you'll
need
to
uh
refer
back
to
the
manual
a
few
times
in
order
to
kind
of
read
up
on
wh
you
know
what
the
hell
you're
supposed
to
be
doing
However
the
biggest
stumbling
block
for
playing
N
F
L
involves
calling
plays
Much
like
Tecmo
Bowl
you
select
an
offensive
or
defensive
position
by
pressing
a
combination
of
buttons
on
the
D
Pad
and
using
the
A
and
B
buttons
However
Tecmo's
game
actually
displays
diagrams
of
the
plays
N
F
L
has
you
entering
your
plays
while
looking
at
the
scoreboard
for
some
reason
Nothing
really
helpful
in
determining
what
play
you
wanna
use
The
manual
has
this
uh
also
not
very
helpful
list
of
plays
but
doesn't
tell
you
the
right
button
combinations
to
press
You
see
originally
this
came
with
a
couple
little
fold
out
play
sheets
that
gave
details
about
the
plays
and
how
to
select
them
However
the
play
sheet
seems
to
have
almost
kind
of
completely
disappeared
down
the
memory
hole
I
couldn't
even
find
a
good
photo
of
it
online
A
few
listings
for
complete
in
box
copies
of
N
F
L
didn't
even
have
the
play
sheet
Now
obviously
you
can
find
guides
online
that'll
tell
you
how
to
input
each
play
but
this
game
is
pretty
much
completely
unplayable
without
having
that
information
So
you
can't
just
like
you
know
buy
a
loose
cart
and
pop
it
in
and
start
playing
One
other
weird
little
thing
most
resources
call
this
N
F
L
Football
yet
the
box
cover
the
game
the
manual
everything
calls
it
just
N
F
L
A
little
strange
Anyway
this
is
the
uh
one
football
game
that
you
should
definitely
pass
on
Our
third
and
final
piece
of
unrepentant
trash
from
L
J
N
is
Who
Framed
Roger
Rabbit
And
we
have
one
of
those
classic
Rare
wall
of
text
just
look
at
this
What's
with
the
flying
question
marks
And
look
at
the
Who
Framed
text
is
that
really
the
best
they
could
do
Why
is
there
such
a
huge
space
between
Who
and
Framed
There
is
just
so
much
typical
Who
gives
a
shit
attitude
from
Rare
in
this
game
Now
I
assume
you're
all
familiar
with
the
movie
Who
Framed
Roger
Rabbit
from
1988
Produced
by
Steven
Spielberg's
Amblin
Entertainment
it
was
an
odd
mashup
of
Chinatown
and
American
animation
of
the
1930s
and
'40s
Bob
Hoskins
plays
a
detective
named
Eddie
Valiant
who
gets
involved
in
the
murder
case
of
one
Marvin
Acme
who
is
an
affair
with
Jessica
Rabbit
wife
of
the
cartoon
star
Roger
Rabbit
Acme's
missing
will
a
major
plot
point
in
the
movie
becomes
the
crux
of
the
story
for
this
game
Who
Framed
Roger
Rabbit
is
I
suppose
an
Adventure
game
of
sorts
The
object
is
mostly
to
go
around
town
collecting
items
Some
of
these
items
will
help
you
advance
the
story
Now
when
you
put
it
like
that
this
sounds
kinda
like
DÃ©jÃ 
Vu
but
in
this
game
the
place
in
Los
Angeles
where
you
walk
around
the
street
and
explore
a
series
of
almost
identical
buildings
all
the
while
trying
to
avoid
getting
hit
by
cars
Inside
a
building
you
will
find
numerous
rooms
which
are
always
full
of
tables
chairs
dressers
and
desks
You
can
open
the
desk
and
dressers
in
hopes
of
uh
finding
a
piece
of
the
will
Of
course
99
of
the
many
many
drawers
have
nothing
in
them
Aside
from
that
you
find
items
just
lying
around
on
the
floor
Some
of
them
are
unique
quest
items
others
are
usable
items
There's
uh
stuff
like
wallets
which
contain
money
items
for
dealing
with
enemies
and
so
on
For
example
the
whistle
will
summon
around
town
quicker
and
he's
required
to
access
later
parts
of
the
game
Now
aside
from
its
impressive
combination
of
live
action
and
animation
the
one
thing
that
stood
out
at
time
in
this
movie
was
the
huge
number
of
guest
appearances
from
various
cartoon
characters
from
different
studios
In
the
days
before
extensive
cross
branding
Who
Framed
Roger
Rabbit
accomplished
what
seemed
to
be
the
impossible
act
of
getting
Mickey
Mouse
and
Bugs
Bunny
together
in
one
cartoon
I
mean
at
the
time
this
seemed
you
know
virtually
miraculous
Of
course
none
of
these
other
characters
were
available
for
this
game
so
the
of
Toon
Town
has
been
reduced
down
to
basically
almost
nothing
Toon
Town
does
appear
later
in
game
but
it's
actually
a
lot
like
Los
Angeles
with
different
looking
buildings
Who
Roger
Rabbit
is
one
of
those
games
that
tries
to
do
many
things
but
doesn't
really
do
any
of
them
well
It
looks
like
an
open
world
Adventure
game
but
there's
really
not
much
interesting
to
find
Exploring
L
A
mostly
just
involves
walking
up
and
down
streets
entering
a
bunch
of
these
identical
looking
buildings
and
picking
up
randomly
scattered
items
You
talk
to
people
but
unlike
in
Sierra
or
LucasArts
games
no
one
ever
says
anything
even
remotely
interesting
There
are
also
some
action
bits
like
shit
falling
on
your
head
when
you
try
to
pick
something
up
or
uh
animals
that
attack
if
you're
not
up
Roger
which
also
kills
you
cars
will
run
over
you
killing
you
everything
in
this
game
is
all
just
so
awkward
and
wrong
For
example
um
you
walk
around
the
street
using
the
D
Pad
you
know
exactly
like
you
would
expect
When
you
hop
in
Benny
the
Cab
suddenly
the
control
scheme
completely
changes
All
Benny
does
is
make
you
move
around
the
streets
faster
yet
for
some
reason
Rare
decided
they
needed
a
completely
different
control
scheme
for
this
On
foot
the
Up
button
moves
up
in
Benny
Up
button
does
nothing
They
went
through
the
trouble
of
actually
creating
this
second
control
scheme
which
adds
absolutely
zero
to
the
game
And
that's
the
weird
thing
about
Rare
I
mean
it's
like
they're
not
lazy
it
seems
they're
not
exactly
cutting
corners
They
put
effort
into
things
that
do
not
enhance
the
game
experience
and
quite
possibly
detract
from
it
Among
other
odd
things
sometimes
Roger
gets
captured
by
these
two
weasels
and
they
tell
corny
old
jokes
you
have
the
correct
answers
This
feels
like
something
Rare
sort
of
threw
does
anyone
actually
enjoy
these
parts
To
me
when
the
weasels
grab
Roger
it's
like
Oh
great
Not
Not
this
crap
again
There
is
some
sort
of
logic
to
some
of
the
puzzles
For
example
you
can't
enter
this
club
until
ya
find
the
password
which
is
placed
of
course
in
some
random
location
in
town
When
you
enter
the
club
you
find
Jessica
Rabbit
You
can
try
to
talk
to
her
but
she'll
tell
you
to
find
her
phone
number
which
I'm
sure
is
also
randomly
hidden
in
one
of
the
buildings
There
are
tons
of
items
in
this
game
usually
with
one
very
specific
use
For
example
there
are
separate
items
for
uh
fending
off
the
wild
uh
cats
dogs
and
snakes
that
attack
you
There's
lots
of
one
time
use
items
like
a
password
or
Jessica's
phone
number
You
can
see
which
item
you
have
selected
up
there
at
the
top
However
get
this
at
various
points
the
weasels
will
attack
We
have
to
fight
them
but
there's
not
just
an
attack
button
you
can
use
No
you
actually
have
to
select
your
fist
or
weapon
at
from
the
items
menu
And
this
is
done
by
I
shit
you
not
holding
down
the
Select
button
while
you
scroll
through
every
item
until
you
reach
your
fist
And
you
cannot
move
while
you're
doing
this
because
you're
using
the
D
Pad
to
browse
through
the
items
So
often
you'll
have
to
sort
of
stop
going
through
the
menu
move
away
from
the
weasel
so
he
doesn't
hit
you
start
going
through
the
menu
again
The
actual
fighting
is
quite
awkward
and
you
can
lose
a
life
if
you
get
hit
too
many
times
Apparently
you
have
a
life
meter
but
it
appears
to
be
invisible
And
those
little
P
s
that
appear
across
uh
the
bar
at
the
top
there
They
apparently
don't
represent
your
life
bar
and
I
swear
I
read
through
the
manual
and
it
doesn't
mention
them
at
all
so
who
knows
what
those
actually
do
There's
so
much
weird
shit
like
this
Like
when
you
start
winding
up
your
punch
you
can't
move
while
doing
so
unless
you
were
already
moving
when
you
started
winding
up
the
punch
then
you
can
continue
to
move
Was
this
intentional
or
is
it
some
kind
of
weird
bug
In
some
ways
this
reminds
me
of
the
old
Atari
2600
game
Raiders
of
the
Lost
Ark
There's
a
lot
you
have
to
do
in
a
very
specific
fashion
but
the
game
is
very
obtuse
about
it
So
you
sort
of
wander
around
randomly
hoping
you'll
be
lead
in
the
right
direction
Even
the
manual
doesn't
tell
you
what
any
the
items
do
Some
of
them
like
the
password
get
explained
in
the
context
of
the
game
but
what
do
rattles
do
What
about
Even
purchasing
items
from
the
store
is
really
not
that
clear
You
need
to
select
a
item
that
what
other
game
does
buying
from
a
shop
work
like
that
I
mean
it's
weird
So
many
games
are
so
intuitive
with
how
the
basic
controls
work
but
here
you
walk
into
your
a
store
and
you're
like
Uh
How
do
actually
buy
this
shit
It's
not
even
clear
what
Roger
Rabbit
does
in
this
game
I
mean
he
follows
Eddie
around
everywhere
but
it's
he's
pretty
much
just
window
dressing
You
can't
control
him
and
he's
totally
useless
for
the
most
part
at
least
in
the
first
half
of
the
game
I
played
I
guess
they
couldn't
figure
out
any
other
way
to
sort
of
work
him
into
the
game
so
he's
just
sort
of
like
this
fellow
who
shadows
you
everywhere
you
go
I
can't
think
of
many
games
that
just
fail
at
so
many
levels
at
once
It's
actually
completely
exasperating
It's
Well
here
we
are
the
big
game
this
episode
Capcom's
DuckTales
the
first
in
a
of
very
successful
Disney
games
from
Capcom
and
I
mean
very
successful
Supposedly
DuckTales
was
Capcom's
biggest
selling
N
E
S
game
It
was
of
course
based
on
the
wildly
popular
animated
T
V
show
that
ran
from
1987
to
1990
which
was
itself
based
mostly
on
the
duck
comics
of
Carl
Barks
from
the
1940s
through
the
1960s
While
Barks
did
not
create
Donald
Duck
or
his
nephews
he
hid
did
introduce
lots
of
characters
like
Uncle
Scrooge
The
Beagle
Boys
Flintheart
Glomgold
Magica
De
Spell
Gyro
Gearloose
and
many
others
Barks
duck
comics
were
among
the
most
perfect
comics
ever
created
and
the
DuckTales
T
V
show
was
basically
a
tribute
to
Barks
in
many
ways
Capcom
released
this
in
the
U
S
first
and
then
gave
it
a
Japanese
release
in
January
1990
under
the
name
Wanpaku
Dakku
Yume
BÅken
or
Naughty
Duck
Dream
Adventure
The
rather
strange
English
text
found
in
both
the
uh
beta
of
the
U
S
game
and
the
Japanese
game
states
that
according
to
Scrooge
the
most
important
treasure
is
Dream
and
Friends
Capcom
had
a
pretty
fruitful
relationship
with
Disney
and
this
was
the
first
Disney
game
that
they
actually
developed
themselves
They
had
published
Mickey
Mousecapade
in
the
U
S
though
that
was
actually
developed
by
Hudson
who
published
the
original
Japanese
release
DuckTales
continues
Capcom's
streak
of
quality
Action
Platforming
games
for
the
N
E
S
We'd
previously
seen
Bionic
Commando
Strider
and
of
course
the
two
MegaMan
games
Just
like
Bionic
Commando
this
uses
a
rather
unusual
mechanic
for
getting
around
Scrooge
can
walk
and
jump
but
the
only
way
he
can
attack
enemies
is
by
using
his
cane
as
a
pogo
stick
Now
this
seems
absurd
Canes
don't
have
springs
in
them
one
nor
do
they
have
a
place
to
put
your
feet
on
and
if
you
look
closely
at
Scrooge's
sprite
you'll
see
that
he's
actually
completely
bent
over
to
the
point
where
his
torso
is
almost
touching
the
ground
He's
holding
onto
the
cane
with
his
hands
and
the
top
end
of
the
cane
appears
to
be
pressed
up
against
his
chest
Attempting
to
pogo
like
this
would
either
impale
him
on
the
cane
or
at
the
very
least
shatter
his
sternum
yet
Scrooge
very
improbably
is
able
to
bounce
around
all
over
the
place
like
this
unharmed
Not
only
can
Scrooge
jump
higher
than
normal
using
the
cane
but
this
is
the
only
way
that
he
can
directly
kill
enemies
by
impaling
them
on
the
end
cane
which
is
I'm
sure
a
very
horrible
way
to
die
All
this
sounds
really
cool
except
for
one
problem
initiating
the
pogo
jump
is
slightly
too
complex
You
need
to
press
A
to
do
a
regular
jump
then
before
hitting
the
ground
press
Down
on
the
D
Pad
and
hold
down
the
B
button
This
doesn't
sound
like
much
work
I
know
but
I
don't
quite
understand
why
it
has
to
require
three
button
presses
The
thing
is
you
use
the
pogo
jump
constantly
I
mean
just
a
reminder
this
is
the
only
way
kill
enemies
if
you
do
a
regular
jump
and
land
on
an
enemy
you
die
Many
many
jumps
in
this
game
can
only
be
done
using
the
pogo
jump
Other
than
that
there
are
lots
of
weird
little
issues
with
it
It
seems
that
if
you
are
running
then
jump
forward
into
a
pogo
jump
you
will
like
stop
moving
forward
when
you
hit
the
it
can
be
hard
to
initiate
the
jump
in
very
tight
quarters
Sometimes
when
you're
like
landing
on
a
narrow
platform
when
you
land
you'll
actually
come
out
of
the
pogo
jump
And
you
can
still
die
while
trying
to
pogo
jump
on
enemies
if
you
don't
hit
them
exactly
right
For
example
right
here
I
thought
I
was
going
to
land
on
this
Beagle
Boy
but
if
we
look
at
it
frame
by
frame
we
see
yes
I'm
getting
quite
close
cane
isn't
quite
lined
up
right
and
Blammo
there
I
go
At
the
of
each
level
you'll
encounter
a
boss
battle
here's
the
first
one
Unfortunately
all
the
bosses
are
pretty
simple
variations
on
the
same
fight
The
boss
moves
around
and
you
pogo
and
land
on
his
head
Then
after
a
few
and
then
you
return
to
the
Level
Select
screen
For
the
most
part
the
main
objective
is
simply
to
find
the
exit
of
each
level
However
while
you're
in
there
you
can
also
search
around
for
money
and
items
Uh
Gems
and
diamonds
are
found
everywhere
They
fall
out
of
the
air
they're
also
inside
treasure
chests
You
can
only
take
a
rather
straightforward
path
to
the
boss
or
you
can
explore
around
a
bit
more
and
find
various
detours
and
alternate
paths
in
order
to
get
more
treasure
You
can
also
occasionally
find
helpful
things
like
ice
cream
and
cake
to
restore
your
health
though
I'm
not
sure
that
birds
can
digest
dairy
products
and
in
a
couple
cases
you
will
find
an
item
that
extends
your
health
bar
There's
also
a
couple
hidden
special
treasures
Once
you
defeat
the
second
boss
Magica
De
Spell
who
is
incidentally
the
only
boss
that
is
actually
taken
from
the
cartoon
instead
of
being
just
some
generic
monster
you
then
go
on
to
the
African
mines
However
you
immediately
run
into
one
of
your
nephews
who
tells
you
you
need
to
proceed
And
the
key
is
found
in
the
previous
level
Yeah
you
actually
have
to
immediately
return
to
Transylvania
and
look
for
the
key
Fortunately
it's
a
very
short
trip
to
the
room
The
mine
level
is
kind
of
strange
and
th
the
path
to
the
boss
is
actually
quite
short
but
there
much
longer
meandering
path
where
you
can
pick
up
lots
of
treasures
and
money
While
playing
DuckTales
it
reminded
me
a
lot
of
the
N
E
S
version
of
Strider
aesthetically
Just
like
Strider
there
a
vibe
of
you
know
Here's
the
cave
level
here's
the
jungle
level
oh
and
here's
a
snow
level
The
computer
thing
cr
Scrooge
uses
between
levels
is
very
similar
to
the
one
Strider
uses
Of
course
DuckTales
is
much
simpler
than
Strider
There's
no
special
items
that
give
you
any
additional
abilities
other
than
the
life
bar
extension
and
there
you
know
are
a
couple
extra
lives
found
here
and
there
But
there's
not
much
backtracking
other
than
that
brief
return
to
Transylvania
It's
pretty
much
a
matter
of
wandering
around
the
level
until
you
find
the
boss
I
mean
sure
there's
exploration
but
there's
not
much
to
find
other
than
diamonds
And
the
question
is
Why
look
for
diamonds
Your
money
counter
is
basically
just
a
score
Diamonds
don't
do
anything
in
the
game
There
no
actual
in
game
benefit
to
picking
them
up
You
can't
spend
them
at
shops
or
anything
like
that
The
only
thing
they
actually
do
is
impact
the
ending
which
we'll
get
to
in
just
The
other
thing
that
bugs
me
is
the
lack
of
any
kind
of
game
story
or
narrative
drive
DuckTales
was
aimed
at
younger
audiences
so
there's
not
a
of
dialogue
but
this
doesn't
really
make
great
use
of
the
DuckTales
license
I
mean
this
could
easily
have
been
developed
as
something
else
entirely
different
and
then
the
sprites
swapped
in
at
the
very
last
moment
Huey
Dewey
and
Louie
just
appear
in
random
places
throughout
the
game
for
no
reason
and
don't
really
do
anything
And
why
is
Mrs
Beakley
in
the
diamond
mine
Or
why
is
Bubba
in
the
Himalayas
frozen
in
a
block
of
ice
It's
interesting
that
people
always
complain
about
Back
to
the
Future
for
like
not
being
faithful
to
the
movie
Did
they
even
see
Back
to
the
Future
before
making
the
game
but
really
did
anyone
at
Capcom
ever
see
an
episode
of
or
were
they
just
handed
character
model
sheets
and
told
Stick
the
characters
in
there
somewhere
Even
the
instruction
manual
doesn't
offer
any
kind
of
story
other
than
simply
you
know
Scrooge
is
looking
for
treasure
DuckTales
is
pretty
repetitive
and
most
levels
are
quite
similar
with
just
the
background
graphics
being
a
little
different
like
in
the
jungle
level
you
climb
up
vines
and
on
the
mine
level
you
climb
up
chains
The
Himalayas
level
is
about
the
only
level
that
sort
of
finds
a
way
to
use
the
environment
to
you
try
to
pogo
on
the
snow
you'll
get
stuck
which
makes
sense
of
course
and
it
does
use
falling
icicles
and
slippery
blocks
of
ice
as
well
Now
please
don't
think
that
I'm
a
bad
game
It's
actually
pretty
good
I
mean
it's
sort
of
unambitious
when
compared
to
other
recent
Platform
Action
games
and
whereas
MegaMan
2
a
labor
of
love
DuckTales
feels
like
competent
guys
making
a
they
were
paid
to
make
Everyone
loves
the
Moon
and
yeah
I
will
admit
pretty
darn
nice
1up
com
once
put
this
game
at
number
9
on
a
list
of
the
best
ever
N
E
S
games
which
seems
quite
frankly
insane
to
me
and
I
grade
this
a
solid
B
maybe
a
B
So
once
you've
found
all
five
treasures
something
of
a
your
treasures
all
get
stolen
somehow
and
a
message
telling
you
to
come
to
Dracula
Duck
Manor
which
turns
out
make
your
way
back
to
the
same
boss
room
as
before
then
face
the
final
boss
Dracula
Duck
He's
a
bit
trickier
than
the
other
bosses
which
are
all
quite
easily
beaten
um
but
here
you
actually
need
to
land
on
a
bat
to
bounce
high
enough
to
hit
him
on
the
head
All
this
seems
to
be
a
uh
Castlevania
parody
homage
rip
off
I'm
not
quite
sure
Once
defeated
uh
Magica
De
Spell
and
Flintheart
Glomgold
appear
and
say
that
they
will
race
you
to
your
treasure
I
don't
even
know
which
one
is
supposed
to
be
talking
or
for
that
matter
how
Magica
or
Flintheart
are
even
connected
to
Dracula
Duck
but
you
do
get
this
very
silly
little
race
where
all
you
do
is
climb
straight
up
the
rope
There's
no
way
you
deliberately
try
Now
there
are
three
possible
endings
There's
the
regular
one
this
one
um
but
if
you
have
uh
ended
the
game
with
more
money
you
get
a
picture
of
Scrooge
on
a
larger
pile
of
treasure
and
if
you
beat
the
game
with
no
money
you
get
a
pic
of
Scrooge
looking
you
know
sad
because
he
has
no
treasure
Overall
it's
a
nice
game
I
wouldn't
put
it
among
the
top
tier
of
Capcom
masterpieces
but
it
is
better
than
90
of
the
crap
on
the
FamiCom
and
it
did
inaugurate
Capcom's
series
of
high
quality
Disney
games
Oh
no
It's
Fester's
Quest
one
of
it
might
not
be
clear
but
uh
Uncle
Fester
was
moonbathing
one
night
when
a
spaceship
kidnapped
a
bunch
of
people
Gomez
must
protect
the
family
so
it's
up
to
Uncle
Fester
to
rescue
all
those
poor
Manhattanites
It's
not
even
clear
what
this
game's
name
is
The
title
screen
says
Uncle
Fester's
Quest
The
Addams
Family
the
box
art
just
says
Fester's
Quest
This
was
developed
and
published
by
Sunsoft
and
only
released
in
the
U
S
and
Europe
What's
it
like
Well
do
you
parts
of
Sunsoft's
Master
Blaster
where
ya
got
out
of
the
tank
and
the
game
became
sorta
like
a
top
down
Commando
type
game
Well
just
imagine
an
entire
game
of
just
those
parts
and
you'll
have
Fester's
Quest
The
game
takes
place
in
Central
Park
I
assume
as
well
as
the
sewers
below
We
don't
see
the
Addams
Family
mansion
per
se
but
instead
there's
several
smaller
houses
which
are
scattered
around
the
park
each
containing
one
member
of
the
family
for
some
reason
Now
I'm
sure
you're
all
familiar
with
The
Addams
Family
and
Uncle
Fester
He
first
appeared
in
the
uh
Charles
Addams
New
Yorker
uh
cartoons
as
an
unnamed
creepy
bald
weirdo
When
The
Addams
Family
was
developed
into
a
T
V
show
in
the
mid
'60s
and
the
cartoon
characters
were
fleshed
out
and
given
names
while
Fester
is
clearly
someone's
uncle
he's
sometimes
described
as
Gomez's
brother
and
sometimes
as
Morticia'a
uncle
Former
child
star
Jackie
Coogan
portrayed
him
in
the
original
show
The
game
draws
some
elements
from
the
character
from
the
T
V
show
such
as
Fester
wielding
a
blunderbuss
and
uh
somehow
being
able
to
power
a
light
bulb
Aside
from
your
gun
and
the
light
bulbs
you'll
also
need
keys
to
open
doors
money
to
buy
hot
dogs
to
refill
your
health
gun
power
ups
as
well
as
items
provided
by
the
other
family
members
such
as
various
types
of
potions
and
missiles
and
so
on
Fester's
Quest
is
usually
regarded
as
a
pretty
difficult
game
for
several
reasons
One
problem
you
might
encounter
early
on
is
that
your
gun's
projectiles
move
in
weird
curved
paths
The
patterns
actually
change
as
you
power
up
the
gun
and
some
travel
in
a
such
a
severe
curve
that
it's
almost
impossible
to
hit
enemies
eh
as
they
close
in
on
you
Or
when
you're
traveling
in
tight
quarters
your
projectiles
will
actually
just
curve
right
into
the
wall
and
you
won't
be
able
to
hit
anything
at
all
Once
you
power
it
up
all
the
way
the
gun
becomes
an
actual
like
wall
of
death
but
gun
power
downs
are
dropped
just
as
frequently
or
probably
moreso
than
gun
power
ups
so
you
can
very
easily
power
down
your
guns
by
accident
At
first
glance
Fester's
Quest
appears
to
resemble
a
Metroid
vania
or
Zelda
type
game
You
have
this
big
maze
like
overworld
and
you
can
explore
around
the
park
find
various
helpful
items
climb
down
into
the
sewers
and
come
out
in
new
areas
In
fact
the
overworld
and
the
sewers
are
two
big
maps
connected
together
at
various
points
with
only
certain
areas
being
being
accessible
at
the
beginning
of
a
game
However
as
the
game
progresses
you'll
see
that
it
becomes
very
very
linear
There's
only
one
specific
path
through
the
world
and
while
there
are
a
few
areas
that
are
slightly
off
the
main
path
the
game
pretty
much
goes
like
this
You
walk
through
a
path
in
the
park
that
ends
in
sewer
entrance
you
go
into
the
sewer
re
enter
the
park
take
the
path
through
the
park
to
a
building
enter
the
building
fight
a
boss
at
the
the
building
and
then
repeat
five
bosses
and
then
you
enter
the
final
level
the
U
F
O
For
some
reason
the
game
throws
in
these
first
person
sections
right
before
the
boss
fights
There's
not
much
point
I
mean
they're
just
small
mazes
with
nothing
in
them
At
the
end
is
a
rather
boring
looking
office
door
wherein
hides
the
boss
All
the
bosses
are
sorta
similar
to
this
a
large
dude
who
moves
back
and
forth
attacking
you
from
above
You
need
to
dodge
his
attacks
which
are
simple
repetitive
patterns
and
shoot
him
until
he
dies
Afterwards
you
exit
and
then
move
on
the
next
level
Now
you
must
admit
The
Addams
Family
was
sort
of
an
odd
subject
for
a
game
in
1989
There
hadn't
been
any
new
Addams
Family
material
since
a
uh
made
for
T
V
movie
in
the
'70s
and
The
Addams
Family
movie
was
still
a
little
over
two
years
away
As
it
turns
out
this
was
sort
of
a
passion
project
from
Richard
Robbins
at
Sunsoft
According
to
an
interview
on
KidFenris
com
the
idea
came
to
Robbins
in
a
dream
and
in
order
to
get
it
made
he
spent
a
great
number
of
uh
phone
calls
to
Addams
widow
in
France
trying
to
convince
her
to
give
him
permission
Sunsoft's
home
office
in
Japan
didn't
understand
why
he
wanted
to
make
this
game
but
obviously
it
was
made
and
it
was
developed
by
the
same
team
as
Master
Blaster
Apparently
the
lack
of
any
sort
of
save
system
was
due
to
a
oversight
and
once
they
realized
the
game
really
needed
one
it
was
too
late
which
brings
me
to
the
other
thing
that
makes
Fester's
Quest
so
damn
difficult
You
can
take
two
hits
before
you
die
What
happens
when
you
die
You
restart
at
the
beginning
no
not
the
beginning
of
a
level
the
beginning
of
the
entire
damn
game
That's
right
if
you
get
killed
um
for
example
like
on
the
final
boss
fight
you
go
all
the
way
back
to
where
you
started
at
the
beginning
of
the
game
and
go
through
the
entire
game
again
Now
granted
you
get
to
keep
your
weapons
and
items
but
still
I
mean
you
get
hit
twice
and
you
have
to
start
all
over
again
that's
insane
Now
there
is
well
hidden
secret
item
that
extends
your
life
bar
to
three
notches
In
fact
apparently
there's
another
one
of
these
that
I
didn't
find
that
gives
you
a
fourth
notch
And
you
do
get
some
potions
early
on
in
the
game
but
only
five
of
them
and
you
can't
buy
extras
anywhere
So
you
have
to
play
through
the
game
in
one
sitting
and
basically
not
make
more
than
a
handful
of
mistakes
Now
after
your
gun
part
way
through
the
game
you
get
a
second
weapon
from
Morticia
a
whip
which
kinda
resembles
the
flaming
whip
of
Castlevania
2
when
fully
upgraded
This
actually
is
a
bit
more
powerful
than
the
gun
but
on
the
other
hand
you
have
to
be
a
more
careful
when
aiming
it
The
final
U
F
O
level
is
full
of
tons
of
difficult
enemies
Um
Though
a
very
helpful
item
you
get
late
in
the
game
is
the
noose
which
kills
all
the
enemies
onscreen
presumably
by
hanging
them
I
guess
Now
should
you
make
it
this
far
luckily
it
turns
out
the
final
boss
which
is
some
kind
of
killer
robot
computer
metal
gear
thing
I
don't
know
but
it
can
be
easily
defeated
if
you
still
have
enough
invisibility
potions
and
missiles
Once
you've
knocked
out
the
guns
up
in
front
you
can
just
stand
right
here
and
its
um
remaining
weapon
can't
hit
you
and
you
can
just
fire
away
with
your
missiles
until
it
blows
up
And
that's
it
I
guess
the
spaceship
decides
to
beam
down
all
the
Earthlings
um
back
to
Earth
right
before
exploding
And
then
the
happy
New
Yorkers
and
you
have
a
little
rave
together
It's
a
shame
that
Fester's
Quest
is
like
so
close
to
being
a
good
game
Just
a
few
tweaks
and
it
would
have
been
pretty
decent
Um
Either
way
though
it
actually
sold
pretty
well
a
million
copies
apparently
So
while
it's
far
from
perfect
it's
still
better
than
Back
to
the
Future
One
last
game
for
September
This
one
also
curiously
a
U
But
listen
to
this
music
Now
if
you've
played
enough
uh
N
E
S
games
your
first
thought
might
be
Now
that
is
some
hella
British
music
I
think
it's
that
little
brrrring
thing
that
gives
it
away
So
Sky
Shark
is
the
first
console
game
to
have
music
by
Tim
Folan
who
had
previously
found
fame
doing
the
music
for
various
games
on
the
Commodore
64
and
the
Z
X
Spectrum
and
uh
you
know
systems
like
that
As
is
often
the
case
with
these
N
E
S
games
that
were
released
in
the
uh
western
market
only
Taito
went
to
a
British
developer
in
this
case
the
infamous
Software
Creations
who
are
also
known
for
such
uh
N
E
S
games
as
Silver
Surfer
and
Wolverine
Sky
Shark
is
a
military
themed
Shooter
where
naturally
you
pilot
an
old
fashioned
looking
biplane
If
Sky
Shark
feels
exactly
sort
of
like
uh
so
many
other
military
Shooters
that's
because
it
is
a
port
1987
arcade
game
originally
developed
by
Toaplan
also
known
under
the
name
Flying
Shark
This
game
feels
a
lot
like
Toaplan's
Twin
Cobra
or
Twin
Hawk
You
face
off
against
hordes
of
uh
flying
enemy
aircraft
along
with
tanks
rolling
along
the
ground
and
boats
shooting
at
you
from
the
water
below
The
original
arcade
game
was
nothing
special
but
reasonably
charming
The
N
E
S
port
rips
out
all
of
the
charm
cranks
up
the
difficulty
quite
a
and
leaves
you
with
a
game
that
is
not
very
enjoyable
So
I
think
you
get
the
idea
here
Shooting
the
series
of
red
planes
will
cause
an
item
to
drop
usually
it's
a
power
up
or
an
extra
bomb
The
power
ups
are
nothing
special
they
just
add
extra
projectiles
to
your
weapon
and
make
the
shots
spread
out
a
bit
more
You
don't
have
any
secondary
weapons
or
anything
like
that
here
In
terms
of
enemies
you
get
your
standard
planes
tanks
mounted
turrets
on
the
ground
you
know
just
the
usual
stuff
Some
boring
bosses
appear
like
this
giant
tank
Don't
really
expect
much
in
the
way
of
originality
when
it
comes
to
this
game
Sky
Shark
really
borrows
a
lot
from
Capcom's
1942
series
For
example
ya
have
parts
where
ya
fly
over
battleships
knocking
out
their
onboard
guns
I
I
guess
it's
not
terrible
There
are
some
slightly
irritating
things
about
Sky
Shark
like
the
way
enemies
are
always
shooting
at
you
from
the
sides
and
from
behind
It's
not
terribly
difficult
I
guess
this
might
have
seemed
cool
back
in
1989
but
after
25
plus
years
of
better
Shoot'em
Ups
Sky
Shark
doesn't
really
hold
much
appeal
now
We
now
October
1989
and
it's
Koushien
We
have
an
almost
elegiac
musical
melody
here
Then
it
picks
up
a
bit
Published
by
K
A
C
it
seems
to
be
assumed
that
this
is
developed
by
S
N
K
though
their
name
isn't
actually
found
anywhere
on
the
front
I
have
also
heard
it
described
online
as
using
the
same
engine
as
S
N
K
's
Baseball
Stars
Alright
so
this
is
rather
clearly
the
uh
Honshin
Koushien
stadium
depicted
on
the
title
screen
Koushien
usually
refers
to
the
uh
high
school
baseball
championships
which
take
place
at
Koushien
Stadium
This
is
has
a
uh
a
reasonably
high
level
of
customization
here
You
can
play
through
the
entire
championships
pick
which
teams
are
gonna
be
in
the
championships
as
is
done
on
this
map
of
Japan
here
swap
out
various
team
members
and
so
on
The
kid
giving
a
speech
here
uh
strikes
a
rather
Fascist
pose
Oh
yeah
and
look
at
the
face
of
the
dude
third
from
the
left
on
the
uh
left
hand
side
of
the
screen
there
The
uh
team
first
up
gets
decided
by
a
game
of
Rock
Paper
Scissors
of
course
The
soundtrack
is
purty
interesting
They
use
like
this
great
deep
drum
sound
in
places
I'm
guessing
this
utilized
a
uh
Now
in
terms
of
how
this
plays
it's
not
as
irritating
as
some
FamiCom
baseball
games
though
I
tended
to
get
a
lot
of
relatively
high
fly
balls
and
the
C
P
U
's
outfielders
will
catch
these
balls
around
a
hundred
percent
of
the
time
As
always
it
can
be
harder
for
you
to
catch
fly
balls
when
playing
defense
because
you
can't
see
where
your
outfielders
are
until
a
ball
gets
pretty
close
to
them
Overall
though
it
is
actually
a
a
a
pretty
well
constructed
baseball
game
however
it
is
one
of
those
games
that
a
pretty
heavily
re
worked
uh
version
released
here
in
the
United
States
in
1990
under
the
name
Little
League
Baseball
Championship
Series
And
while
it's
not
quite
as
an
impressive
a
catch
F
L
license
this
is
an
official
Little
League
baseball
video
game
just
in
time
for
the
ah
51st
anniversary
of
Little
League
baseball
since
this
came
out
in
the
U
S
in
summer
of
1990
Um
Maybe
it
was
planning
on
being
released
earlier
and
didn't
quite
make
it
And
this
was
actually
published
by
S
N
K
in
the
U
S
However
actually
load
this
thing
up
all
of
the
animations
and
screens
in
the
intro
have
been
completely
changed
But
you
know
the
overall
structure
remains
the
same
Om
Instead
of
having
uh
like
the
map
of
Japan
this
is
where
you
pick
the
teams
you
want
to
actually
play
in
the
championship
from
an
international
roster
of
various
teams
The
Rock
Paper
Scissors
game
has
been
replaced
with
the
traditional
thing
where
you
put
your
hands
on
the
ah
the
baseball
bat
The
game
itself
is
pretty
similar
to
the
original
The
sprites
of
the
batters
have
been
changed
but
the
pitcher
the
basemen
and
the
outfielders
remain
exactly
the
same
Unfortunately
the
music
gets
a
pretty
heavy
downgrade
losing
those
great
pounding
drums
I
really
don't
wanna
sell
this
short
because
Little
League
Baseball
is
actually
a
pretty
solid
game
I
love
the
little
touches
like
the
pitchers
you
know
sort
of
bawling
out
the
other
players
when
they
fail
to
get
a
runner
out
or
this
absolutely
marvelous
Home
Run
screen
I
mean
just
look
at
all
those
faces
pretty
much
the
best
Home
Run
screen
we've
seen
so
far
in
in
in
any
baseball
game
and
why
are
they
cheerleaders
in
the
stands
though
So
final
conclusion
Koushien
a
k
a
Little
League
Baseball
is
a
pretty
damn
playable
game
really
sort
of
the
polar
opposite
of
L
J
N
's
N
F
L
I
mean
we
have
a
lot
baseball
games
on
we
do
have
one
last
sports
game
this
episode
Ah
here's
another
game
with
a
somewhat
confusing
naming
history
World
Super
Tennis
a
k
a
Top
Players
Tennis
a
k
a
Four
Players
Tennis
Published
by
our
good
buddies
Asmik
this
is
I
believe
the
second
Asmik
FamiCom
game
we've
seen
the
first
being
a
Mahjong
game
that
employed
a
uh
license
Just
like
that
game
World
Super
Tennis
appears
to
have
developed
by
a
little
company
called
Game
Data
It
features
the
names
and
likenesses
of
two
tennis
champs
Ivan
Lendl
who
was
top
t
uh
the
top
ranked
male
tennis
player
in
the
world
at
at
this
time
and
a
bit
strangely
Chris
Evert
who
was
I
think
retired
by
the
time
this
game
came
out
She
dominated
the
women's
tennis
world
in
the
mid
'70s
to
late
'70s
However
um
she
was
perhaps
the
best
female
tennis
player
ever
at
least
in
the
pre
Serena
Williams
era
So
aside
from
Lendl
or
Evert
you
can
create
your
own
custom
character
here
a
you
know
or
girl
Now
in
1990
this
got
a
pretty
straightforward
port
in
the
U
S
under
the
name
Top
Players
Tennis
Chris
Evert
Ivan
Lendl
They
added
some
voice
samples
and
uh
prominently
put
Evert
and
Lendl's
name
in
the
title
Also
one
thing
they
reversed
the
order
in
which
they
appear
in
the
intro
Lendl
comes
comes
first
in
the
Japanese
version
and
Evert
is
first
in
the
U
S
version
Other
than
that
though
pretty
much
everything's
about
the
same
You
have
multiple
play
modes
for
up
to
four
players
So
playing
against
the
computer
there
is
a
career
mode
of
sorts
You
need
to
beat
three
opponents
to
win
the
tournament
After
this
you
move
on
to
several
real
life
tournaments
such
as
the
uh
French
Open
and
so
on
So
the
first
dude
is
pretty
easy
Probably
the
hardest
part
is
serving
Ya
need
to
hit
the
ball
when
it's
relatively
high
up
in
the
air
In
fact
the
ball
to
me
looks
like
it's
still
well
ab
way
above
your
head
when
you
make
contact
But
when
I
swing
at
the
point
where
the
ball
appears
to
be
at
the
correct
height
I
always
get
a
fault
Though
on
the
other
hand
I
mean
your
player
appears
to
be
the
same
size
no
matter
where
you
are
in
the
foreground
or
background
so
I
guess
it
appears
unnaturally
short
while
you're
standing
at
the
baseline
I
don't
know
it
it's
kinda
weird
you
sorta
have
to
swing
the
racket
like
too
early
in
order
to
get
a
good
serve
So
using
either
the
A
or
the
B
button
you
can
lob
the
ball
or
perform
a
faster
swing
You
can
get
up
close
to
the
net
and
do
a
smash
and
your
racket
has
a
little
bit
of
reach
There
were
times
when
I
thought
I
wasn't
going
to
quite
hit
the
ball
and
I
ended
up
just
barely
making
it
somehow
When
you
run
around
your
player
has
a
of
momentum
so
it
actually
takes
a
second
to
sort
of
stop
or
change
directions
I'm
actually
reasonably
impressed
by
the
way
this
handles
Tennis
games
can
be
a
bit
monotonous
however
and
I
I
really
can't
possibly
imagine
having
the
dedication
to
play
this
game
all
the
way
through
to
its
conclusion
Uh
For
each
opponent
you
play
multiple
games
and
multiple
sets
so
it
actually
takes
a
while
to
beat
As
you
win
you
get
points
which
unlock
new
moves
and
also
the
opponents
get
much
tougher
Now
for
some
reason
in
1992
this
was
released
in
Europe
with
Lendl
and
Evert
completely
stripped
out
under
the
name
Four
Players
Tennis
It's
the
exact
same
game
only
they've
been
replaced
with
two
more
generic
players
Anyway
I
can't
say
I'm
a
huge
fan
of
this
but
it's
certainly
not
as
awful
as
some
of
the
other
tennis
games
we've
seen
and
it
is
actually
reasonably
playable
at
least
for
a
little
bit
from
Varie
and
apparently
developed
by
Human
whom
we've
been
seeing
doing
quite
a
bit
Now
you
wouldn't
know
it
from
the
incredibly
boring
box
art
but
this
is
based
on
a
manga
and
animÃ©
both
of
which
were
quite
recent
The
manga
only
started
in
1987
and
the
animated
film
version
in
mid
1989
Created
by
veteran
illustrator
and
character
designer
Yoshikazu
Yasuhiko
It
happened
to
come
out
during
the
U
S
manga
craze
of
the
late
'80s
early
'90s
so
it
got
translated
into
English
and
published
by
Dark
Horse
pretty
quickly
The
animÃ©
was
released
in
the
U
S
on
uh
V
H
S
tape
a
couple
years
later
Now
this
only
came
out
in
Japan
of
course
but
we
do
have
nice
translation
by
J2E
Translations
who
are
known
for
their
Final
Fantasy
IV
translation
from
the
early
2000s
So
wow
In
2003
a
comet
hits
Venus
and
greatly
changed
the
landscape
of
Venus
and
Earthlings
colonized
it
Then
a
war
happened
Um
By
way
Ishtar
uh
Terra
and
Aphrodite
Terra
are
in
fact
real
parts
of
Venus
So
Venus
Senki
revolves
around
the
rebel
biker
group
Hound
which
is
a
terrible
name
for
your
biker
gang
and
their
struggle
to
retake
uh
some
captured
city
in
Venus
or
something
like
that
So
what
kind
of
game
is
this
R
P
Up
Nope
It's
a
Military
Tactics
game
in
the
vein
of
Military
Madness
So
here's
your
crew
Carts
sounds
like
a
name
that
somehow
got
mangled
in
translation
from
uh
English
to
Japanese
and
then
back
to
English
again
Notice
a
level
and
points
Yep
your
team
members
get
points
as
they
kill
enemies
and
can
actually
Level
Up
throughout
the
game
pretty
basic
stuff
here
These
are
your
guys
eight
bikers
and
two
transport
vehicles
These
transports
are
actually
uh
really
the
key
to
the
some
ways
You
and
the
enemy
take
turns
moving
your
units
around
When
you
attempt
to
move
onto
a
space
occupied
by
an
a
unit
from
the
other
side
a
battle
will
ensue
Now
throughout
Chrontendo
we've
seen
sort
of
two
forms
of
these
type
of
games
There's
the
ones
where
the
battles
just
play
out
automatically
like
in
Military
Madness
and
generally
the
stronger
unit
wins
And
then
there's
the
other
kind
where
you
actually
have
to
do
something
during
the
battles
and
your
actions
will
help
determine
whether
you
win
or
lose
In
Venus
Senki
the
battles
are
fought
in
like
little
Space
Harrier
type
uh
minigame
Enemies
rush
at
you
as
you
and
you
would
have
to
ah
to
shoot
them
down
Actually
you
win
by
um
a
not
dying
and
b
destroying
ten
of
these
special
enemies
Lots
of
weak
generic
enemies
come
by
you
and
in
between
these
will
be
like
these
more
powerful
enemies
such
as
these
flying
ships
You
need
to
shoot
ten
of
these
special
enemies
in
order
to
defeat
the
entire
unit
However
these
battles
only
last
one
minute
So
if
you
don't
manage
to
kill
ten
in
that
time
period
the
battle
ends
in
sort
of
a
draw
Aside
from
your
standard
weak
laser
gun
you
have
guided
missiles
which
kill
most
enemies
much
easier
but
are
very
limited
Once
you've
destroyed
all
the
enemy
units
on
the
screen
you
win
the
level
and
then
it's
on
to
the
next
So
very
very
Military
Madness
like
It's
also
not
terribly
sophisticated
The
mechanics
sort
of
encourage
a
defensive
strategy
You
have
eight
units
so
you
can
surround
your
transports
with
them
and
then
let
the
enemies
come
to
you
And
here's
the
reason
why
the
transports
act
as
support
units
Having
them
adjacent
to
one
of
your
own
units
will
repair
it
and
refill
its
missiles
So
there's
a
huge
advantage
in
sort
of
in
battles
to
kind
of
keep
your
units
next
to
a
transport
at
all
times
Now
I
admit
there
is
a
certain
fascination
with
these
odd
hybrid
games
like
Venus
Senki
or
Maharaja
The
problem
with
most
of
them
is
that
the
individual
parts
just
aren't
that
interesting
The
action
sequences
in
Venus
Senki
would
be
like
the
most
boring
Space
Harrier
clone
ever
if
they
were
released
as
a
game
by
by
themselves
And
there's
virtually
no
strategy
in
the
overworld
sections
You
only
have
one
kind
of
unit
so
there's
really
like
no
Rock
Paper
Scissors
type
mechanics
that
you
see
in
many
of
these
Strategy
games
You
never
build
more
units
and
your
own
army
never
changes
so
it's
actually
pretty
monotonous
And
weaving
two
uninteresting
games
together
doesn't
really
create
an
interesting
game
as
it
turns
out
so
Venus
Wars
is
at
best
a
curiosity
Holy
cow
When's
the
last
time
we
saw
a
FamiCom
Disc
System
game
Well
I'll
tell
ya
the
answer
It
was
Magma
Project
Hacker
back
in
August
so
there've
only
been
two
F
D
S
games
in
the
entire
second
half
of
1989
so
far
F
D
S
games
will
continue
to
dribble
out
sporadically
for
quite
a
while
It
took
a
really
long
time
for
the
system
to
die
off
completely
This
is
the
second
and
final
game
in
Nintendo's
FamiCom
Mukashibanashi
series
of
Adventure
games
The
first
was
called
Shin
Onigashima
which
came
out
around
two
years
prior
Just
like
that
game
YÅ«yÅ«ki
was
released
in
two
parts
The
first
disc
came
out
on
October
14th
and
the
second
on
November
14th
It
was
once
again
developed
by
Nintendo
E
A
D
and
Pax
Softnica
The
first
Mukashibanashi
game
used
characters
and
ideas
from
the
stories
of
uh
MomotarÅ
and
uh
Tale
of
the
Bamboo
Cutter
YÅ«yÅ«ki
draws
heavily
from
Journey
to
the
West
The
title
YÅ«yÅ«ki
means
something
like
Journey
Record
or
Travel
Diary
I'm
not
really
sure
what
the
best
way
to
translate
that
is
The
game
opens
up
with
two
meteors
heading
towards
Earth
It
turns
out
that
they
are
Goku
who's
based
on
Sun
Wu
Kong
the
monkey
king
and
a
bad
guy
named
uh
Gyumaou
An
orphan
girl
named
Chao
though
you
can
give
her
and
Goku
different
names
when
you
start
the
game
if
you'd
like
um
she
frees
Goku
from
the
meteorite
and
they
become
friends
Just
like
the
previous
Mukashibanashi
game
the
design
here
is
meant
to
be
very
very
traditionally
Japanese
The
text
is
displayed
in
these
animated
scrolls
and
they
read
top
to
bottom
While
this
gives
these
games
an
instantly
recognizable
and
distinctive
screen
layout
the
window
that
displays
like
the
actual
graphics
of
the
characters
and
whatnot
is
tiny
Lots
of
FamiCom
Adventure
games
and
R
P
G
s
have
screen
layouts
that
use
lots
of
bars
and
boxes
and
windows
that
take
up
space
but
this
must
be
the
game
with
the
least
amount
of
screen
space
devoted
to
displaying
the
graphical
illustrations
of
the
game
world
If
we
isolate
it
from
everything
else
we
can
see
that
it
takes
up
less
than
a
sixth
of
the
screen
So
YÅ«yÅ«ki
isn't
that
great
of
a
game
visually
In
terms
of
how
it's
played
it's
actually
much
simpler
than
the
first
one
There's
very
little
puzzle
solving
and
in
some
ways
it
resembles
more
of
an
interactive
storybook
than
a
game
Because
the
text
speed
has
been
uh
sped
up
a
bit
it
actually
moves
quite
a
bit
faster
Everything
in
the
first
game
moved
very
slowly
for
some
reason
Supposedly
playing
through
YÅ«yÅ«ki
takes
about
a
quarter
of
the
time
that
it
did
to
get
through
Shin
Onigashima
It
uses
a
lot
of
the
same
mechanics
such
as
switching
between
various
characters
throughout
the
game
Whereas
Shin
Onigashima
has
been
re
released
on
the
Game
Boy
Advance
and
the
Virtual
Console
poor
YÅ«yÅ«ki
has
been
pretty
much
forgotten
though
Chao
and
Goku
make
a
uh
cameo
appearance
in
a
couple
of
the
Kirby
Dreamland
games
Nintendo
would
release
another
two
part
F
D
S
Adventure
game
in
1991
called
Time
Twist
and
then
their
odd
little
experiment
with
this
format
would
be
over
Alright
let's
wrap
up
folks
Hokuto
no
who
did
the
first
two
might
recall
I
did
not
actually
care
for
those
games
of
course
uh
Shouei
System's
name
also
appears
on
the
title
screen
Shouei
having
some
kind
of
connection
to
Bear's
Every
Fist
of
the
North
Star
game
we've
seen
so
far
has
been
a
super
basic
Beat
'em
Up
uh
but
now
we
finally
switch
things
up
a
bit
You
see
this
one
is
an
R
P
G
Holy
crap
Look
at
this
Look
that
purple
person
What
the
you
doing
Why
are
you
waving
your
arms
around
like
that
Uh
So
anyway
this
is
pretty
standard
R
P
G
stuff
here
with
a
few
eccentricities
The
building
on
the
left
is
the
weapons
shop
I
take
it
based
on
the
teeny
tiny
sword
hanging
above
the
door
And
for
some
reason
all
the
shops
are
like
this
It
looks
like
you're
entering
a
dungeon
or
something
but
no
there's
this
long
hallway
and
then
the
shopkeeper
is
all
the
way
in
the
back
It's
really
pretty
annoying
Wandering
around
talking
to
people
you'll
find
a
couple
characters
who
join
you
Uh
This
isn't
like
Dragon
Quest
2
or
something
where
you
gotta
wander
around
for
a
couple
hours
looking
for
them
Both
these
guys
are
like
literally
just
standing
around
in
the
first
tiny
little
town
and
will
instantly
join
you
if
you
talk
to
them
If
you
must
know
these
second
Hokuto
no
Ken
movie
I
think
There's
actually
a
few
things
in
this
game
that
deviate
from
you
actually
start
with
a
decent
money
enough
to
buy
basic
weapons
and
armor
for
all
three
characters
You
also
have
an
ability
found
in
the
menu
to
warp
um
to
other
locations
that
you've
heard
about
And
Lin
has
a
Heal
command
that
can
be
in
combat
which
is
available
right
from
the
get
go
Random
encounters
aren't
super
frequent
Um
I
suppose
it's
either
good
if
you're
to
travel
from
one
area
to
the
other
and
you
don't
wanna
get
in
fight
every
three
steps
um
or
it's
bad
if
you're
trying
to
grind
and
you
wanna
Level
Up
The
sprite
work
in
this
game
is
mostly
pretty
terrible
looking
but
the
art
um
that
appears
during
the
battle
sequences
is
actually
pretty
nice
looking
in
a
very
sort
of
uh
primitive
sort
of
way
I
love
the
animation
on
the
faces
when
they
get
attacked
It
really
looks
like
they're
getting
brutally
beaten
up
So
is
this
game
one
that
actually
wanna
play
one
that'll
get
fan
translated
into
English
Uh
No
probably
not
But
at
least
it's
a
bit
of
a
break
from
all
the
routine
Fist
of
the
North
Star
Beat
'em
Ups
Alright
What
a
fascinating
train
wreck
of
an
episode
For
Best
Game
this
time
I'll
probably
have
to
say
DuckTales
While
I'm
not
a
huge
fan
it's
somewhat
ambitious
and
well
constructed
Not
exactly
my
favorite
Capcom
game
by
a
long
shot
but
honestly
what
other
choices
are
there
today
TwinBee
3
maybe
Worst
Game
Many
of
you
might
say
Back
to
the
Future
which
I
hated
but
I'm
gonna
go
with
Who
Framed
Roger
Rabbit
Back
to
the
Future
is
crap
but
at
least
there's
less
of
it
Who
Roger
Rabbit
is
like
a
sprawling
mess
of
crap
It's
like
the
difference
between
you
know
your
cat
pooping
on
the
floor
and
the
sewer
main
breaking
and
flooding
your
house
with
shit
Back
to
the
Future
I
could
deal
with
I
mean
sure
it
stunk
but
it
was
controllable
Who
Framed
was
like
the
one
game
that
psychologically
broke
me
I
didn't
want
to
have
to
play
it
think
about
it
or
talk
about
it
As
a
matter
of
fact
the
voice
over
for
Who
Roger
Rabbit
was
the
absolute
last
thing
recorded
for
this
episode
even
after
this
actually
as
I'm
speaking
it
has
still
not
yet
been
recorded
Anyway
next
time
we
have
uh
three
baseball
games
a
Mahjong
game
some
T
V
game
show
games
a
Dragon
Ball
game
And
on
the
other
hand
the
game
that
was
translated
into
English
under
the
name
Princesstual
Orgy
is
coming
up
And
just
like
Jesus
no
Bio
Monster
it's
one
of
those
games
where
you
see
that
title
and
you
go
Holy
crap
What
the
hell
could
that
possibly
be
So
at
least
I'll
finally
get
to
find
out
Before
then
we'll
have
some
more
non
Chrontendo
content
coming
out
On
Dr
Sparkle
After
Dark
we'll
cover
the
very
difficult
to
comprehend
movie
Frozen
Scream
a
film
that
was
actually
quite
hard
to
see
for
years
and
years
until
quite
recently
Just
like
the
Roger
Rabbit
game
I
have
no
idea
what
I
can
even
say
about
this
movie
Also
there'll
be
some
additional
interesting
stuff
soon
so
keep
an
eye
for
that
In
the
mean
time
thanks
for
watching
and
I'll
see
ya
later
